# Photo of Conelia Doing Needlework

*Madeline*

Illuminating relationships, or, at least, noticing the outlines of them, is one of the unique results of archival exploration. Material objects and their journeys through time, space, and hands reveal not only historic processes, but also personal ones. This photograph, in its careful composition and light arrangement, speaks to the relationships of the singular woman featured as well as the ghosts of the manor that float around, behind, and through her. Though listed in the finding aid as “unidentified woman,” comparative analysis determined that the subject of this photograph is Cornelia Horsford, the inheritor of Sylvester Manor in 1900 and its dedicated caretaker for decades afterward. The idea of Cornelia as a steward of the home and its inhabitants is likewise inherited with the photograph, as the pose of her arm above the taut fabric calls our attention to her as an archetypical woman of the age. Needlework and similar craftworks were part of the traditional duties of a woman in this time period, though were unessential, and so were only available to those with ample time and material resources. As the photo is clearly staged, the activities and props intentionally lead us to these ideas. In this snapshot of her life, Cornelia and the photographer emphasize her place– physically and socially. 

Throughout the Sylvester family’s archives, the notion of Cornelia’s affection for the wellbeing of her family’s home is unavoidable. The ways in which it is expressed vary, and often are surprisingly illustrative of her individual personality, emphasizing things like her attention to detail and artistry. Archival collections preserve not just the history of places and people, but the methods they took up, the breadth of their spirits; these are what the entries in this series are intended to explore. However, some archives can also (without external effort) preserve the historic status quo. Cornelia, as the subject of the photo, can simultaneously work to highlight her very real effort while over-asserting her presence, shadowing other labor that is absent from the archives, especially from sources that the archival record marginalizes. While this photo entry serves to remind us of Cornelia’s place and personality, it should also be taken as documenting only one of those present at the Manor.
