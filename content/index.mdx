## About the Project

This project seeks to bridge the gap between the Sylvester Manor Archive, a large archival collection at NYU, and its user communities by utilizing digital humanities technologies to accomplish the following objectives:

- Aid the History & Heritage staff at the Sylvester Manor site in developing educational public programming utilizing primary sources from the Sylvester Manor Archive.
- Highlight archival records and narratives of marginalized and underrepresented people who lived and worked at Sylvester Manor, including enslaved people, indentured servants, Indigenous people, free people of color, working-class people, and women.
- Provide a space for teaching and learning about the history of Sylvester Manor while the site is closed for renovations.

This project is a three-year Mellon Foundation-funded collaborative initiative between NYU and the Sylvester Manor Historic Site. The project began in Fall 2024 and is expected to conclude in Fall 2027.
